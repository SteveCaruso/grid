# IDEA
## Interactive Design, Entertainment & Arts

A proposed merger of the Game Dev, Game Art, and IDMX Programs at RVCC:

* **[Interactive Design, Entertainment, & Arts (IDEA) A.A.S. (Program Outline)](./degrees/aas.md)**

The resulting program would have the following (based on Spring 2024 Fact Book figures):

| Total Majors* | Total Enrollments** |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| 70            | 165                 |

The number of enrollments for this new program will likely be much higher, because a larger proportion of the curriculum is made up of program-specific courses. As a result, IDEA students will be taking an average of **3.25 to 3.75 program classes per semester**, compared with 1.5/semester for Game Art, 1.75/semester for Game Dev, and 2.0/semester for IDMX.
