# GRID
## Game & Real-Time Interactive Design

A proposed merger of the Game Dev, Game Art, and IDMX Programs at RVCC:

* **[Game & Real-Time Interactive Design (GRID) A.A.S. (Program Outline)](./degrees/aas.md)**

The resulting program would have the following (based on Spring 2024 Fact Book figures):

| Total Majors* | Total Enrollments** |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| 70            | 165                 |

The number of enrollments for this new program will likely be much higher, because a larger proportion of the curriculum is made up of program-specific courses. As a result, IDEA students will be taking an average of **3.25 to 3.75 program classes per semester**, compared with 1.5/semester for Game Art, 1.75/semester for Game Dev, and 2.0/semester for IDMX.

### Major Program Milestones

The "core" of the GRID Program is made up of:

1. **Three 1-credit courses**:
    1. **[Intro to GRID](./classes/intro-to-grid.md)** which exposes students to program expectations, good habits, and direct academic advising,
    1. **[Current Issues in GRID](../classes/current-issues-in-grid.md)** which keeps students up to date with the latest trends in the field, and 
    1. **[Digital Portfolio](./classes/digital-portfolio.md)** wherein students build a solid portfolio to document all of their achivements.
2. **[Creative Computing I](./classes/creative-computing-i.md)** which introduces fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques for interactive media, focusing on logic, basic programming, and creative applications in digital environments.
3. **[Creative Computing II](./classes/creative-computing-ii.md)** which expands on programming skills with more complex concepts and applications, incorporating industry-relevant tools and workflows for game development, web applications, and interactive experiences.
4. **GRID Production I** which focuses on the development pipeline for interactive projects, teaching students how to plan, prototype, and iterate on digital experiences using industry-standard tools and methodologies; and
5. **GRID Production II** which emphasizes finalizing and polishing interactive projects, with students applying advanced production techniques, collaboration skills, and portfolio development to prepare for industry entry.


### Program Trajectory

**Semester 1:** Students are given an overview of the coursework and field before they build foundational skills in creative computing, game design, web development, and digital art. They gain an introduction to programming, interactive media principles, and the creative and technical aspects of game development.

**Semester 2:** Focus shifts to applying technical skills in game engines, user experience design, and more advanced programming in Creative Computing II. Students also begin customizing their learning path by selecting their first elective.

**Semester 3:** Students transition into production-based learning, where they apply their knowledge to interactive projects in GRID Production I. They further refine their specialization by choosing another elective while expanding their analytical skills through an ethics course and fulfilling their math requirement.

**Semester 4:** The final semester emphasizes portfolio development, industry awareness, and advanced project work in GRID Production II. Students complete their remaining electives and general education requirements while preparing for career opportunities through portfolio-building and discussions on current industry trends.
