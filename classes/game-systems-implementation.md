## II. Catalog Description

**Prerequisites: A grade of C or higher in 112 - Creative Computing 2** This course explores the differences between proof of concept prototype code and basic code engineering concepts to allow for maintainability and extensibility. It allows for teams to segment a project to discrete modules for implementation and testing priopr to assembly into a final formal for publishing.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** The digital game industry is driven by the principles of software creation and engineering in the pursuit of providing entertainment. It is necessary for game developers to know when code effort should be taken so that it can be engineered for modifcation and longevity and when the code is "g ood enough" for its intended purpose. Topics include reducing explicit coupling between gameplay systems, writing cohesive, extensible game system objects, designing code for mutliple players interacting across a network, and selecting from available messaging systems to implement multiple systems into a single product 
- **B.** This course requires the use of a Computer Lab for game development software and digital collaboration platforms.
- **C.** Transferability of Course: This course may transfer as a free elective or as part of a Game Design or Digital Media degree program.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for GRID.
- **B.** Free Elective
- **C.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.
