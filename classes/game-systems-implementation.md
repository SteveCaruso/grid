## II. Catalog Description

**Prerequisites: A grade of C or higher in 112 - Creative Computing 2** This course explores the differences between proof of concept prototype code and basic code engineering concepts to allow for maintainability and extensibility. It allows for teams to segment a project to discrete modules for implementation and testing priopr to assembly into a final formal for publishing.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** The digital game industry is driven by the principles of software creation and engineering in the pursuit of providing entertainment. It is necessary for game developers to know when code effort should be taken so that it can be engineered for modifcation and longevity and when the code is "g ood enough" for its intended purpose. Topics include reducing explicit coupling between gameplay systems, writing cohesive, extensible game system objects, designing code for mutliple players interacting across a network, and selecting from available messaging systems to implement multiple systems into a single product 
- **B.** This course requires the use of a Computer Lab for game development software and digital collaboration platforms.
- **C.** Transferability of Course: This course may transfer as a free elective or as part of a Game Design or Digital Media degree program.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for GRID.
- **B.** Free Elective
- **C.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.

## V. Outline of Course Content

1. Introduction to decoupled game code
    - why prototype code is useful
    - why prototype code creates long term challenges for implementation
    - Understanding fundmantal software design principles as applied to game development
      
2. Event driving game messages
   - overview of different methods of decoupled communication
   - Engine specific event syntax and implementation
   - Language specific event syntax and implementation

3. Game Play systems
    - Developing the core game loop for the genre in use (will vary by semeseter)
    - creating event/messaging hooks for testing
    - creating event/messaging hooks for other systems for later implementation

4. Game Visual Effects systems
     - Developing VFX options 
     - creating event/messaging hooks for testing
     - creating event/messaging hooks for other systems for later implementation
  
5. Game UI systems
     - Developing UI systems including HUD, menus, transitions
     - creating event/messaging hooks for testing
     - creating event/messaging hooks for other systems for later implementation
  
6. Game Network systems
     - Developing network client and server processes
     - creating event/messaging hooks for testing
     - creating event/messaging hooks for other systems for later implementation

7. Systems integration and testing
     - coordinating messaging between systems
     - playtesting and debugging
     - demonstrating the product
