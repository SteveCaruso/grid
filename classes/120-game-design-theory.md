## II. Catalog Description

This course introduces the creative process of game design and development for students hoping to enter the game industry. The student will learn about the structure of the game industry and develop the foundational skills required of a professional game designer. In this course students will learn a formal method of analyzing analog and digital games. Topics covered include identifying formal and dynamic elements of games, diagramming structures of existing games, creating new game systems, writing a game rule set and planning for the conversion from an analog to digital game.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** Students wishing to become professional game designers need to understand how to objectively analyze existing games to identify the design choices and systems chosen by the game’s creators. This can only be accomplished by developing the student’s understanding of the iterative process.
- **B.** This course has a lab component to allow students to: develop broader game literacy, to implement the team based iterative process of game systems development, and to create the rule sets, game components and planning documents needed to present a formal game design.
- **C.** This course generally transfers as a game design or game development program requirement or as a general elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for GRID.
- **B.** Free Elective
- **C.** This course serves as a Computer Elective on the Computer and Programming
Electives List
- **D.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.

## VII. Grade Determinants

1. Homework - The student will complete homework assignments throughout the
semester to develop their understanding of the formal language of game analysis and
of games as systems.
1. Game Analysis – Students will create a paper detailing their analysis of several
popular board, card and video games.
