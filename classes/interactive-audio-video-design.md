## II. Catalog Description

This course will cover the theory, as well as practical applications, of audio and computer video techniques as used in the game industry. Emphasis will be placed on methods of sound integration and video effects and how they impact character development and enhance the game-playing experience. Additional audio topics covered include: sound perception, waveform editing, sound effects and an introduction to MIDI, music composition and voiceovers. Computer video topics include: image composition, virtual cameras, motion capture and video compression.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** Students planning a career in game development must have at least a general knowledge of audio and computer video techniques to allow them to communicate with the specialists in these areas. Additionally, specific knowledge of video and audio techniques is necessary in the development of game characters, synchronization of sound and animation and to create additional layers of richness in the game environment
- **B.** This course requires the use of a Computer Lab for research, presentations, and discussions.
- **C.** This course generally transfers as a game design or game development program requirement or as a general elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for PROGRAM.
- **B.** Free Elective
