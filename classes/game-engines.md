## II. Catalog Description

This course will introduce students to the art and programming aspects of developing for commercial game engines. The focus will be on the processes and techniques necessary to add creative and advertising components into functional computer game models. Students will work with game development programmers in industry standard software (Unity, Construct) on a series of modular assignments.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** This course is fundamental for the rest of the Game Art program. Students learn the essential technical and creative skills necessary to make art for video game and related interactive environments.
- **B.** This course has a lab component that is required for students to work on both studio art and technology based game design. Students will be required to use computers, scanners and tablets, to perform tasks such as digital drawing and programming.
- **C.** This course will generally transfer to institutions offering game and multimedia based design degrees. The skills used in this course will be required for transferring into any corresponding programs.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** Free Elective
- **B.** This Course meets a requirement for the A.S. Game Art degree.
- **C.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.
