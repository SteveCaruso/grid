## II. Catalog Description

Modern JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. While JavaScript was initially created to be the scripting language for web browsers, over time developers started applying JavaScript for a number of other purposes. The topics covered in the course include core language concepts, how to stay current with evolving language specifications, writing JavaScript for both the client-side (web) and server-side programs such as NodeJS, and using NPM, the world’s largest software registry. This course will also cover distributed development using industry-standard version control along with modern cloud services, such as GitHub.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** JavaScript (in the ECMAScript family of languages) is a popular Scripting language used in Industry to design and implement dynamic web pages. Knowledge of this subject matter is essential to those students pursuing programs in Interface Design, Web Development, and related fields.
- **B.** This course requires the use of a Computer Lab. Students are required to use the software in the Computer labs or on their personal devices in order to complete their assignments.
- **C.** Transferability of Course: This course may transfer as a free elective or as a Computer Science elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum
