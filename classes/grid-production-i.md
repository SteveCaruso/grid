## II. Catalog Description

This course introduces students to the production pipeline for interactive digital experiences, including games, simulations, and multimedia applications. Students will learn how to plan, prototype, and iterate on projects using industry-standard tools and workflows. Emphasis is placed on teamwork, project management, and design iteration, preparing students for real-world development environments.

This course lays the groundwork for GRID Production II, where students will expand on their projects, polish their work, and prepare professional portfolios for industry applications.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** As the demand for skilled professionals in game development, interactive media, and creative computing continues to rise, students require hands-on experience in developing and managing interactive projects. GRID Production I provides a structured environment where students apply design and development principles to real-world projects, fostering teamwork, technical expertise, and problem-solving skills essential for industry success. This course serves as a critical stepping stone for students to build their portfolios and gain practical experience in interactive production.
- **B.** This course has a weekly lab component. The lab is essential for providing students hands on programming time.
- **C.** This course generally transfers as a game design or game development program requirement or as a general elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for GRID.
- **B.** Free Elective
- **C.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.
