## II. Catalog Description

This introductory course in Creative Computing explores the dynamic intersection of technology, art, and design. Students will gain foundational programming skills using languages like Java and JavaScript in conjunction with design oriented libraries, while also delving into digital media fundamentals, including images, audio, and video.

Key topics include interactive media concepts for game design. Students will learn principles of programming and create engaging projects using tools like Processing and p5.js. In addition, students will explore sound and music programming, and the importance of collaboration in interdisciplinary projects. Ethical considerations surrounding technology's impact on society will also be discussed.

By the end of the course, students will have developed a portfolio of creative projects, showcasing their ability to blend technical skills with artistic vision. This course is ideal for those interested in pursuing careers in game development and creative technology.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** Unlike traditional introductory computer science courses that emphasize business or scientific computing, this course introduces students to programming for digital media manipulation. It provides a technical foundation in digital media formats commonly used in video games and other interactive media. This knowledge also serves as a basis for understanding how various creative computing tools—such as the Adobe Suite, 3D modeling software, audio production tools, and game engines—process data to produce specific outputs.  
  
Throughout this course, students will explore key topics relevant to game development, including input handling, data transformation, image blending, digital animation, and audio effect processing. These concepts are essential for further coursework in game development.
- **B.** This course has a weekly lab component.  The lab is essential for providing students hands on programming to write Java/JavaScript programs using the processing environment.
- **C.** This course generally transfers as a game design or game development program requirement or as a general elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for PROGRAM.
- **B.** This is a General Education Elective course that satisfies Technological Competency (pending approval)
- **C.** Free Elective
- **D.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.
