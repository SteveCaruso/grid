## II. Catalog Description

**Prerequisite: A grade of C or higher in ???? 1?? Programming for Creative Computing** This course builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in **Programming for Creative Computing** by exploring advanced programming techniques for digital media and interactive design. Students will deepen their understanding of object-oriented programming, algorithms, and real-time interactivity while working with Java, JavaScript, and frameworks such as p5.js and Processing.

Key topics include generative art, advanced animation, procedural content generation, physics-based simulations, and real-time data visualization. Students may also explore integration with external devices and sensors, as well as networking for interactive projects.

By the end of the course, students will have developed a collection of advanced projects that demonstrate their ability to create complex interactive media applications. This course is ideal for students pursuing careers in game development, digital art, and creative technology.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** This course extends the principles of **Creative Computing I** by introducing advanced digital media programming techniques essential for game development and interactive media. Students will explore more complex programming methodologies, including recursion, data structures, and physics-based animation, to create immersive experiences. This course also provides insight into working with real-time data, APIs, and device interactions.

- **B.** This course includes a required weekly lab component where students will implement interactive projects using Processing and JavaScript.

- **C.** This course generally transfers as a game design or game development program requirement or as a general elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for PROGRAM.
- **B.** Free Elective
- **C.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.
