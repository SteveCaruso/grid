## II. Catalog Description

**Prerequisites: A grade of C or higher in GRID 111 - Creative Computing I;** This course equips students to understand the theory behind and develop practical experience in implementing user interfaces for electronic, multimedia-driven devices.

## III. Statement of Course Need

- **A.** Computer systems are now a ubiquitous part of everyday life, and how we interact with and through them shapes how we perceive, communicate, and interact with our colleagues, family, and friends, as well as how efficiently we carry out all of our digital tasks. As a result, a deep understanding of the psychology of and best practices behind designing these interfaces (a field commonly referred to as “User Experience” or “UX”) has become increasingly important at virtually every point of human-computer contact.
- **B.** This course requires the use of a Computer Lab to both learn the software necessary to create user interface assets, as well as to assemble practical user interface projects.
- **C.** Transferability of Course: This course could transfer as a free elective or as a Computer Science elective.

## IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum

- **A.** This course meets a program requirement for the Interface Design & Web Development A.A.S., A.S., and Certificate.
- **B.** Computer Elective on the Computer and Programming Electives List
- **C.** Free Elective
- **D.** To see course transferability: a) for New Jersey schools, go to the NJ Transfer website, www.njtransfer.org; b) for all other colleges and universities, go to the individual websites.
