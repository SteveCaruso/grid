# IDEA Associates of Applied Science

IDEA (Interactive Design, Entertainment, and Arts) is an interdisciplinary program designed to equip students with the creative and technical skills needed to excel in digital media, game development, and interactive computing. Blending design principles, programming, user experience, and rich media production, the program prepares students for careers in game design, web development, interactive storytelling, and emerging creative technologies. With hands-on projects, industry-standard tools, and a focus on innovation, students build a strong foundation in both artistic and technical aspects of interactive media.

Graduates are able to:

* Design and develop interactive digital experiences, including games, web applications, and multimedia projects, using fundamental programming and design principles.
* Use industry-standard tools and technologies for creative computing, game development, interactive art, and rich media production.
* Solve technical and design challenges in interactive media by applying critical thinking and problem-solving skills in interactive design, user experience, and systems implementation.
* Collaborate effectively in multidisciplinary teams to produce polished, portfolio-ready projects that demonstrate technical and artistic proficiency.
* Stay current with industry trends and emerging technologies, continuously improving their skills for career growth.
