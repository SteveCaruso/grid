# GRID Creative Computing Certificate

GRID (Game and Real-Time Interactive Design) is an interdisciplinary program designed to equip students with the creative and technical skills needed to excel in digital media, game development, and interactive computing. Blending design principles, programming, user experience, and rich media production, the program prepares students for careers in game design, web development, interactive storytelling, and emerging creative technologies. With hands-on projects, industry-standard tools, and a focus on innovation, students build a strong foundation in both artistic and technical aspects of interactive media.

The Creative Computing Certificate aims to give a strong foundation to the concepts of the field.

Graduates are able to:

* Design and develop interactive digital experiences, including games, web applications, and multimedia projects, using fundamental programming and design principles.
* Use industry-standard tools and technologies for creative computing, game development, interactive art, and rich media production.
